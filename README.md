# RL Gridworld and Continuous Environment

Custom **NxN Gridworld Environment** built with **Gymnasium** and **Pygame**, where an agent must find a goal while avoiding danger.  
The project evolves from a baseline **random agent**, to **Q-learning**, and finally a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implemented in PyTorch.

## Features
- âœ… NxN customizable environment
- âœ… 8 possible discrete actions
- âœ… Reward system:
  - -0.1 per vertical or horizontal step
  - -0.15 per diagonal step
  - -10 on danger (episode restart)
  - +10 on reaching the goal
- âœ… Baseline random agent
- âœ… Q-learning implementation
- âœ… Deep Q-Network (DQN) training
- âœ… Live visualization with Pygame
- âœ… Training curve plots
